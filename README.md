## Selected projects

### 🌌 ExoNet: AI-Powered Exoplanet Classification (AI & Scientific Data Project)
Developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**, ExoNet (ExoClass) is a deep learning pipeline designed to classify exoplanet candidates from NASA’s **K2 mission data**.  
- **Core Model**: Residual Multi-Layer Perceptron (ResidualMLP) with skip connections, dropout, and batch normalization.  
- **Capabilities**:  
  - Processes raw K2 mission data with preprocessing & feature engineering.  
  - Classifies candidates into *Confirmed*, *Candidate*, or *False Positive*.  
  - Achieves **95.28% accuracy** on test data.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Robust against imbalanced classes (Focal Loss + AdamW optimizer).  
  - Explainable AI via **SHAP interpretability**.  
  - Scalable to future missions (TESS, Kepler).  
- **Tools & Tech**: Python, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP, Jupyter Notebook.  
- **Dataset**: NASA Exoplanet Archive – K2 Planets and Candidates (4004 entries, 95 features).  
- **Future Impact**: Expanding to TESS/Kepler datasets, deploying a web-based prediction platform, and enabling automated retraining.

### 📰 Interactive Chatbot Interface for News Summarization (NLP Project)
This project provides a chatbot-style interface for automated news summarization, built with **Streamlit** and powered by **Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash model**.  
- **Automated Summarization**: Generates concise summaries (≤ 5 factual sentences) from long-form news articles.  
- **Topic Extraction**: Identifies the top 3 topics covered in an article.  
- **Question Generation**: Produces 3 thought-provoking questions for deeper reflection.  
- **Conversational Design**: Maintains interaction history in a chatbot-style GUI.  
- **Evaluation**: Benchmarked using the CNN/DailyMail dataset with ROUGE metrics (ROUGE-1: 0.41, ROUGE-2: 0.25, ROUGE-L: 0.39).

### 🍌🍅 Fine-Grained Fruit Quality Assessment (Computer Vision Project)
Developed as part of a **Neural Networks course**, this project applies deep learning to classify fruit quality and ripeness levels for bananas and tomatoes.  
- **Dataset**: Labeled food images across 7 categories (banana overripe, ripe, rotten, unripe; tomato fully ripened, green, half-ripened).  
- **Challenge**: Addressed significant class imbalance using targeted augmentation (flips, rotations, brightness, zoom) and dynamic class weighting in TensorFlow.  
- **Models Compared**:  
  1. **Hybrid CNN–Transformer** – combined CNN feature extraction with Vision Transformer for global relationships.  
  2. **AlexNet** – adapted with dropout and max pooling for hierarchical feature extraction.  
  3. **Custom Inception** – multi-path feature extraction with compact efficiency.  
- **Results**:  
  - CNN–Transformer: **95% test accuracy** (best generalization).  
  - AlexNet: **93% test accuracy**, but prone to overfitting.  
  - Inception: **78% test accuracy**, efficient but less accurate.  
- **Tools & Tech**: Python, TensorFlow, CNN, Vision Transformer, AlexNet, Inception, Data Augmentation.
